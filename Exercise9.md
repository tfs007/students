# Security and Backup Awareness
## Task:
1. Install a backup plugin (e.g., **UpdraftPlus**).
2. Set up a scheduled backup (you do not have to execute it now).
3. Install a basic security plugin and review its dashboard (e.g., **Wordfence**).


### Checklist:
1. Backup plugin installed
2. Scheduled backup configured
3. Security plugin dashboard reviewed
