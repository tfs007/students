##  **How to Show Only Travel Posts (or any category)**

2. Assign blog posts to the **Travel** category
3. Copy the URL from **View** (e.g., `/category/travel`)
4. In **Appearance > Menus**, add this as a **submenu** under Blog

Now, **Blog → Travel** shows only travel posts!

**Outcome:** A responsive, personal brand website with blog and shop, structured for user-friendly navigation with **functional submenus**, category-filtered views, and a ready-to-expand foundation.
